# Kaggle DonorsChoose Competition

For final submission, I selected Python logistics model and R GLM using only categorical and numerical variables, which turned out to be a bit overfitting (~70th on leaderboard). My best but unfortunately unselected model (could push me to ~30th) is a Python GLM which also uses only non-textual features.
